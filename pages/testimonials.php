                    It was an absolute pleasure working with Taystan Design, LLC. Ms. Taylor, the owner, is very knowledgeable and professional. I am the President of Kids Sew Genius Foundation Inc, a youth organization in Decatur, GA. We needed our website revamped and updated. She communicated clearly throughout the whole project, so I never had to guess what was happening next. She updated me along the way. She worked fast and completed the project as scheduled. I would love to work with her again! My experience was seamless and stress-free, the project was completed in just a few days and exceeded my expectations! Take a look for yourself, at www.ksgf.org. It's apparent that she enjoys what she does. Thanks to Taylor, we now have a website that we are SEW proud of! We highly recommend Taystan Design LLC to anyone who needs assistance with their website.

Her timeliness, attention to detail and expertise of website building surpassed my expectations and turned this project into a success. Her decision making and problem solving are magnificent. I recommend her for all website needs you may need!
